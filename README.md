# GDW5_Prersonal_Portfolio

I  heavily followed the tutorial series [Smart Enemy AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3PbGRazKg&list=PLNwKK6OwH7eW1n49TW6-FmiZhqRn97cRy) by [Ali Elzoheiry](https://www.youtube.com/@AliElZoheiry). For transparency, 90% of the blueprint codes was from this videos with some changes as I was using the tutorials to learn the to make the exact type of AIs in his tutorials. Although not every part of his tutorial series was followed, I must give a huge amount of credit to his series and his help in teaching me AI Behaviour Trees in Unreal Engine 5.
